# statscalc
statscalc is a simple command-line tool that solves basic statistics equations with three step math. This program was made to assist me on my intro to statistics final and for this reason shows the steps in which you would produce results. The program will print the original formula, the formula with values substituted in for the variables, and lastly the solution (three step math).

Run the command-line executable in Terminal or run the project in Xcode. Inputs are numbers (no units). If you screw something up, you can type an invalid input to return to the menu. The program will never terminate until you explicitly close it.

**statscalc can solve the following:**
1. Confidence Interval
2. Prediction Interval
3. Tolerance Interval
4. Confidence Interval with a Proportion (Simple)
5. Confidence Interval with a Proportion (Complicated)
6. Two Sample t-Confidence Interval (Equal Variances)
7. Two Sample t-Confidence Interval (Unequal Variances)
8. Comparison of Two Proportions
9. Coefficent Confidence Interval
10. More Samples in a Confidence Interval
11. More Samples in a Proportion
